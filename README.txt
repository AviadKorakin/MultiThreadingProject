There is still a problem with Stack and Heap overflow, its might solved if we write it to a file and not on the page stack and heap since its limited size.
Or we will limit the search MAX_Files ,etc, the solution in this project is suppost to demonstrait the idea behind multithreading and not focused on search size.
